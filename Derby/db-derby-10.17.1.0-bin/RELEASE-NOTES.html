<p>Compared with the previous release (10.16.1.1), Derby release 10.17.1.0 introduces the following new features and incompatibilities. These merit your special attention.</p>

<div>


<h4>Summary of Change</h4>

<p>
Denial of service attacks might have been possible when using LDAP authentication.
</p>


<!-- 
  DESCRIBE WHAT IT IS THAT THE USER ACTUALLY SEES WHEN THE PROBLEM OCCURS.

  For instance:

  In the previous release, applications were able to open two
  InputStreams on the same column. Depending on how these streams
  interacted, the value siphoned out of the column was erratic. Now
  Derby raises a SQLException when the application attempts to create
  the second InputStream.
-->


<h4>Symptoms Seen by Applications Affected by Change</h4>

<p>
An LDAP injection vulnerablilty was identified. It was assigned this id: CVE-2022-46337.
Credit for finding the vulnerability goes to 4ra1n and Y4tacker.
Someone exploiting this vulnerability might have been able to log on with a bizarre user name
which looked like an LDAP protocol string. The user would then have been able to create
and populate tables and therefore exhaust disk resources.
The vulnerability was closed by escaping LDAP protocol strings.
</p>


<h4>Application Changes Required</h4>

<p>
No application changes are necessary.

<a name="Verifying Releases"></a>Verifying Releases</h2>
<div>


<p>It is essential that you verify the integrity of the downloaded
files using the PGP and SHA-512 signatures.  SHA-512 verification ensures the
file was not corrupted during the download process.  PGP verification
ensures that the file came from a certain person.</p>


<p>The PGP signatures can be verified using
<a href="https://www.pgpi.org/">PGP</a> or
<a href="https://www.gnupg.org/">GPG</a>.
First download the Apache Derby
<a href="https://www.apache.org/dist/db/derby/KEYS">KEYS</a>
as well as the <code>asc</code> signature file for the particular
distribution. It is important that you get these files from the ultimate
trusted source - the main ASF distribution site, rather than from a mirror.
Then verify the signatures using ...</p>


<pre>
% pgpk -a KEYS
% pgpv db-derby-X.Y.tar.gz.asc

<em>or</em>

% pgp -ka KEYS
% pgp db-derby-X.Y.tar.gz.asc

<em>or</em>

% gpg --import KEYS
% gpg --verify db-derby-X.Y.tar.gz.asc

</pre>


<p>To verify the SHA-512 checksums on the files, you need to use a
platform-specific program. On Mac OSX, this program is called
<code>shasum</code>, on Linux it is called <code>sha512sum</code>,
and on Windows it is called <code>CertUtil</code>.</p>


<p>We strongly recommend that you verify your downloads with both PGP and SHA-512.</p>
